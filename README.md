## Overview

This repository contains an Excel-based sales analysis project completed during the Data Technician Skills Bootcamp. The task focused on analysing a fictional cookie sales dataset using core Excel functionality and producing a short written insights report.

The project demonstrates foundational analytical skills, including working from a raw dataset, performing calculations, summarising results with pivot tables, and communicating findings clearly.

## Task Context

The exercise was designed to assess spreadsheet competency rather than advanced tooling. Emphasis was placed on:

- Correct use of formulas
- Logical analysis of sales data
- Clear interpretation of results
- Professional written communication of insights

## Approach

I began by reviewing and validating the dataset to ensure it was suitable for analysis. From there, I used Excel formulas to calculate key metrics such as totals and averages, and pivot tables to summarise sales performance across products and categories.

The outputs of the analysis were then translated into a concise insights report, written for a non-technical audience and focused on what the data shows rather than how it was calculated.
